# 30 Dashboards in 30 Days Challenge

Welcome to my **30 Dashboards in 30 Days** challenge! This repository contains 30 unique, functional dashboards built with real data sources and deployed on Netlify.

## Challenge Overview

The goal is simple: build one dashboard every day for 30 days, each solving a real problem or providing valuable insights using live data. Every dashboard is fully functional, responsive, and deployed as a separate Netlify site.

## üìù Daily Log

### Day 1 - GitHub Activity Tracker

- **Focus:** Personal GitHub analytics and contribution visualization
- **Key Features:** Commit history, repository stats, language breakdown
- **Challenges:** GitHub API rate limiting (it's supposed to be 60 requests an hour, but I seem to get limited way faster), data visualization (It seems GitHub doesn't allow scraping data older than 30 days?)
- **Learnings:** Creating a working heatmap for contributions that's similar to GitHub's is proving to be difficult. I gave up.

### Day 2 - Multi-City Weather Tracker

- **Focus:** A simple weather tracker that uses the OpenWeather API to pull real-time data for various cities in Africa and the world.
- **Key Features:** Weather data + temperature in C & F, search functionality for any city in the world
- **Challenges:** Setting up OpenWeather API and securely using it with Netlify
- **Learnings:** It's actually pretty easy to integrate the OpenWeather API. Like Streamlit, Netlify lets you easily add secret variables like API keys.

### Day 3 - Cryptocurrency Tracker

- **Focus:** A simple crypto tracker that uses CoinGecko's free API to pull 7-day data for various coins. Supports personal portfolio holdings
- **Key Features:** CoinGecko API-powered chart and prices + portfolio holdings section
- **Challenges:** Making the portfolio holdings section proved challenging, but AI proved useful for learning.
- **Learnings:** It's nice that CoinGecko let's people use their API for free. You don't even need to sign up!
